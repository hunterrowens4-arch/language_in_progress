    <h1>Language in Progress</h1>
    <p>Not fluent? Neither am I - Let's make language learning less confusing.<br><br>Hi, I'm Hunter. I've been fascinated with foreign languages for a few years now, and am learning Spanish, Japanese, and Russian.

I won't make you fluent, but I'll make it less confusing.</p>
