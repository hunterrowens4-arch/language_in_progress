    <p>Everyone always says that you can't learn a language without practically using it in some way. That's where immersion comes in. There are plenty of ways to practive immersion, and we will touch on them later. But immersion by itself isn't perfect. It helps train your mind that your target language is something to use, not just something to study. But you still have to do a little extra to maximize your time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I've been doing immersion sessions for a while now, and eventually I noticed that while my ear was getting better at listening along comfortably, I was frequently just not understanding what I was listening to. Then I would hear a word that I recognized from a previous session, but just couldn't quite remember the meaning. So I started keeping an immersion notebook. Now when I'm doing my immersion sessions, I write down any phrases that contain words I don't know and the translation. Writing the entire phrase, not just the unknown word, is better because often times, context has a lot of influence on a word's meaning. This made the session itself more active, which helped, but I knew it could be even more useful.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Language learning isn't always glamorous. Memorization is a large part of it. So I started taking those phrases in my book and adding them to an anki deck. Every now and then I go back and review those decks to expand my vocab. Not to mention, whatever words show up in your immersion sessions are probably words that directly relate to your interests and topics you would use in day to day life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you're doing immersion without taking any extra time to review the vocabulary from what you're immersing yourself in, you're not making the most of your time. Immersing in and of itself is a necessary tool in language learning, for sure. But if you're more intentional about your study sessions, your progress will grow exponentially.</p>
