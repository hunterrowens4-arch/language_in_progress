    <p>The most efficient way to learn a language is to focus on just one. But if you've been learning for a while, you also know how frustrating that can feel - reviewing the same words repeatedly or feeling like progress has stalled.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are many ways to deal with this, but one of the most enjoyable methods I've tried is adding another target language (TL).</p>
    <br>
    <p> Some people will read that and immediately think: <em>"That's counterproductive!"</em> And honestly, they're not wrong. But the biggest thing I've learned in my language journey is this: consistency beats intensity every time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Who care how efficient a method is if you burn out after a month and quit? Even if you return later, you've lost time and momentum. If I rotate between target languages, I may progress more slowly in each one - but if I'm still showing up every day I'm still progressing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At any given time, I maintain one "primary target language." I choose it based on which language I'm most likely to need in the near future. Priorities change, and that shift alone can refresh motivation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Novelty is a powerful motivator. Maintaining multiple languages - and occasionally shifting priority - keeps the process engaging and helps prevent burnout.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I currently maintain three target languages. I wouldn't universally recommend that number, because it can occasionally feel like too much. But language learning is a long-term process, and enjoyment matters. Each language serves a practical purpose, but the overarching reason I continue is simple: I enjoy learning them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To manage them, I use a simple rotation. I practive only one language per day to avoid confusion. My primary language is studied every other day, while the others alternate between sessions. A typical week might look like this:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Monday - Russian</li>
      <li>Tuesday - Spanish</li>
      <li>Wednesday - Russian</li>
      <li>Thursday - Japanese</li>
      <li>Repeat</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>During each session, I combine structured vocabulary practice using tools like Duolingo or Anki with immersion through media such as music, videos, and podcasts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Language learning isn't a race - it's maintenance. the goal isn't perfect efficiency. The goal is staying in progress.</p>
