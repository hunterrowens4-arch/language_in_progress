    <p>I didn't always like foreign languages. I took Spanish in high school and just didn't care. Years later I wanted to learn it again, but by that pointmost of what I learned was gone. I had to start over.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Eventually I started getting frustrated because I felt like I wasn't making progress, so I added Japanese for variety, then Russian. I'm self-taught, experimenting with different strategies and resources to keep my learning moving.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Learning stays interesting that way - but it doesn't make it easy. Every language has its own challenges, but a lot of the struggles are the same across languages: grammar rules or knowing what a word means, but not when to use it. And is it just me or are numbers hard in every language for some reason?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Since I've started learning languages seriously I've made it a goal to learn multiple. So I'm always looking for new ways to study better. That's why I started writing this. As I find new resources that work and as difficult concepts click, I'll add them here and explain how I got there. This log is a growing resource for myself - and any other language learners who happen to find it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There logs may be messy. My opinions may change. I'm not fluent, and I will be wrong sometimes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But if you're learning a language too, you're welcome to learn with me.</p>
